I strongly object to ANY program that places foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition or the education competition.  There are way too many out of work US Citizens AND Veterans right now.  We need to tighten our immigration and freebies to non-citizens.  Whether those people are legal or illegal does not make a difference while so many US Citizens are out of work and struggling! Do NOT pass any more freebies to non-Citizens programs!I am one who has had to change my employment focus due to Federal Government mandates.  This has to stop!
Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a very bad plan. A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed several disturbing facts about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand. Two of them are:OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; andOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.The proposed regulations are "irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it."The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'This rule must not go into efffect.Thank you,Mr. and Mrs. Charles R. Hofacker

This rule provides a great chance for foreign students who work hard and also talented to have better opportunity to further practice what they have learnt at the university. While they are doing their OPT, building their own practical professional experience, they have also contributed a lot to the development of US economy. This rule would benefit both the foreign students and also the US society. I myself support it much.
As the trend of the previous years shows,  skilled immigrants have made huge contributions in the innovation and ground breaking research. With this comes more jobs and opportunities. It is my firm belief that immigrants need to be given the time and benefit of the superior technology in America to help build the foundation for  a culturally diverse, fundamentally strong economy that will help everyone  live better lives.  With a 24 month extension on the OPT , the skilled workforce has enough motivation and time to create something that could potentially change the world.
The new rule will help a lot of international students to explore new horizons in life and provide them ample time to get trained and compete in the field of interest they wish to . I strongly welcome this decision and look forward to a better future.
I am against expanding training opportunities for F-1, International students.Jobs should be given to U.S stem workers &amp; American students seeking stem careers.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>
I am strongly opposed to the proposed expansion of the optional practical training (OPT) program.  This is another way for companies to hire cheap foreign labor at the expense of American workers. I was directly impacted by programs such as this. I have two degrees in mathematics and had a career of software development. Then I was forced into early retirement after having been laid off twice.  Please do not let this happen to other American workers. Thank you.

Please accept this comment on the rule proposed b y the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT). I understand that this program gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.It is clear that not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. My complaint is supported by a 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) that found there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.   The EPI study found that encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact: wage suppression in tech-related fields.I stand up for U.S. STEM workers and American students seeking STEM careers and ask you to reject OPT.
As a displaced STEM worker this is insanity that our own government would promote foreigners over citizens... We no longer have a government by and for the people and these types of actions will make our citizens revolt to have our heritage and posterity handed over to others that have no ties to this nation, its wrong and will only hasten our demise.

Dear Sir or Madam,I am a graduate international student studying at University of Nebraska at Omaha. The extension of OPT is really important for us who own an American dream. With the extension, we may have three chances to access to H1B Visa which legalizes us to stay and work here, helping a lot for us to achieve our dreams.Sincerely,Zhiyuan Chen
*OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and*OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.One of my kids is a STEM worker. He has worked very hard to get where he is today to learn his job, be an exceptional employee, earn promotions and, most importantly, take care of his family. Why should a foreigner be able to swoop in and take a job from a Hard Working American without a need for them to have that job other than a whim by our government?Why does our government want to destroy our middle class and put families into possible financial ruin because they no longer think Americans are worthy of a STEM job?There is something seriously wrong with a system that so easily replaces Hard Working Americans with less skilled foreigners. Why is so easy for our government to take money from Social Security and Medicare without thinking of our senior citizens possibly not having access to the money they worked so hard to earn?Shame on our politicians and our government for treating Americans like trash to be discarded in favor of foreign workers!

Dear Chief Westerlund:I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.As an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and graduated in May 2015with a masters degree in the field of Electrical Engineering. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM GraduatesThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.The Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 MonthsIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.ConclusionMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.The most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.Sincerely,Zhao Cheng

Employers should be given incentives to employ American students first and disincentives to employ foreign students.  If this country cannot provide sufficiently qualified students of its own then surely that tells the educators of this country they are not doing their duty!Furthermore a President who thinks he can introduce such a scheme and bypass not only 'We The People' but the students of 'We The People' has no business running the highest office in the land.
The immigrant-friendly culture in U.S. has made it the best country in the world. Definitely thumb up for the proposed rule!

This is just another method of GOVT pandering to big business to drive down wages.  STEM college students shouldnt have to compete with foreign students who will accept lower wages just to stay here.  If you want more Americans to take STEM degrees stop giving their jobs away.
The Department of Homeland Security is proposing the expansion of the OPT program for foreign students. At the least this is counter productive for American workers because of the following:OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; andOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.This expansion must not take place.
I am a graduated student of Mechanical Engineering. That's a major need practice. You can learn how the tools work theoretically, but not in application. The expending is really help and strongly needed.

I hear that Homeland Security is proposing a program that will add opportunity to illegals. Is my information correct? If the information is correct,how long are you fools going to fight against American U.S. born citizens? What is wrong with you? Why do you hate natural born Americans? How much more of this foolishness are we to adhere to? I oppose any efforts to further the war on U.S. born citizens!!! We pay taxes, pay to educate our children then have to compete with our own ruthless federal government for opportunities. I am ashamed of you.
This will definitely attract more talented students to US, which will increase the local economy as well as the number of skilled workforce in the states. Strongly agree with this.
This is an important proposal, since a period of 12 months is not enough for a student to find a job.  We are speaking about foreign nationals that are professional prepared since they received graduate, post graduate and even post doc degrees. This will give them also more chances to be selected in the H-1B CAP.
24 months STEM extension rule is a correct decision. It will be a good opportunity for everyone.
I support this decision for the reason that STEM students help in technological advancement of the nation and improve economy. Some people say that non-citizens are taking away the jobs, but the fact is that not many companies are ready to offer employment to non-citizens. Only 25% of good companies are ready to offer employment to non-citizens, this is in no comparison to the number of opportunities that the US citizens have.
First of all when these programs were implemented it was with the requirement that employers had to aggressively advertise for American workers. If after a period of time qualified workers could not be found then and only then could companies request H1-B foreign workers with Master degrees. Companies have been allowed to go around these requirement to the extent they are not firing American workers and replacing them with foreign cheap labor. There is no shortest of qualified American workers for these IT positions.
Although I am not a STEM major, I strongly support the STEM extension new policy. I live in the Silicon Valley, and I know much technology and tech companies contributed to the GDP of the country and the atmosphere of the tech prosperous of Silicon Valley. More importantly, STEM extension will NEVER harm job opportunities for the U.S. Citizens. First, if both an U.S. Citizen and an international STEM candidate are qualified and powerful candidates for a tech position, a company will still prefer to hire the citizen. Second, the new policy will benefit MORE U.S. citizens in fields other than STEM because in those fields less employers will be willing to sponsor H1b visa to the international candidates. They know that the total amount of H1b visa will not change, but the probability of STEM major winning the H1b visa increases. That basically lowers the probability that non-STEM majors winning the lottery, which makes less of the employers willing to take the risk. In other words, this policy is actually gaining more work opportunities to citizens from all the non-STEM fields, which have lot more job opportunities than STEM fields. Obviously, this policy is not only a way to attract more STEM experts from all over the world to maintain the countries' tech global position, but it also will benefit the citizens by saving more non-STEM job opportunities to them. Since It won't change the total amount of H1b visa winners every year, it would only gain STEM internatinal H1b candidates more opportunities from INTERNATIONAL non-STEM candidates, but NEVER from citizens.
A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; andOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.This plan makes sure that foreign-born graduates will take jobs that American college students need and it also exempts foreign-born employees from payroll taxes.There are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.Our citizens need protection for Social Security and Medicare!

Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.ConclusionThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields.

This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the F-1 non-immigrant students and the U.S. technology companies. Without this rule, the 1-year OPT can only guarantee students to work for U.S. companies for one year. Companies usually spend a few months in training a new employee and have to find a replacement in year. With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit production. If U.S. government can not retain those students with STEM degree after graduation, then that will only benefit other competing countries.

They aren't US citizens. Circumventing Congressional approval is unlawful. The Administration wants to raise the minimum wage but, at the same time pay American STEM workers less money by hiring non citizens. Is this a joke? Scrap this biased program and place qualified American citizens in these jobs. Only then, if you can't fill all required positions do you offer them to non US citizens. The F-1 program needs to be 12 months period. Let's build this country on the backs of qualified Americans not political favoritism.
Hi Team,This is the best proposal to safe guard the international students and eventually benefit the US economy. Thank you for reviewing and coming up with a optimum solution. We appreciate your decision and help.
You know if you don't wish to put Americans first you ought to move to another country!  Do the right thing and protect our jobs FIRST before even thinking of offering foreigners positions.
ABSOLUTLY no foreign workers ahead of Americans.  It is way past time for this government to stop coddling those immigrants over Americans.  What planet are you people living on?  Don't you know this is just one more way of helping Obama destroy our country?  You live here too, have two ears and eyes also, so why can you not see what he is doing.  STOP the insanity now!The cheap labor companies are paying now to hire labor from outside the US will come back to bite the companies doing this.  Has our world just come down to dollars and cents, or will it begin again with Sense returning to the Corporate World.  If that does not happen, does anyone in your company see what the future will be for your company who has joined Obama to destroy America?
The proposed rule of extension would surely help the STEM students to enhance their knowledge in their respective fields. It would also help the U.S government in economy and also encourage foriegn students. I will accept the rule for extension and it would help every one. STEM students are very happy with the proposed rule and surely the number will increase in coming years.
At a time when STEM workers in this country are being laid off and replaced with H1B immigrants, I think the question that really needs to be asked is if this bill is going to benefit the citizens of this country, or is it going to benefit big business and the CoC.What this rule proposes is to create more cheap competition in an already wage stagnant field, hence cause more job loss of citizens.
Yoy may as well just OUTLAW employing Americans and get it over with.
There is no need for further examination of the F-1 visa program, there has been plenty of study of this already; it is a destructive program that provides employers with cheap labor and gives the foreigner a virtual free greencard, the value of which is in the tens of thousands of dollars.The program HARMS American college students and destroys the careers of older American workers.There is also the security issue in play; why are we offering sensitive jobs to those with no allegiance to America?It is obscene that "our" government is complicit in this ugly scheme.
I fully support this proposal. STEM students are a valuable resource to growth not just in tech fields but also in any field that uses technology and should be retained as much as possible
Thanks for guaranteeing that I, with my physics degree since 2009, will continue making 10 to 12 dollars an hour part time in a job totally unrelated to STEM while big companies continue to import foreigners to do STEM work, to TRAIN to do the work, and my taxes help them pay for it all. Thanks for representing me, the American Citizen, in all this. You are truly serving the pubic, uh, I mean public.
Improving and Expanding OPT for F1-VISA students is really necessary and beneficial. It allows international students to have more time to practice and apply their skills to professional settings and gain experiences. Students majoring in stems are usually capable and talent. It's a win-win for both international students and the companies who hire them. It's also good for the economy.

I am sick and tired of the US Government giving preferential treatment to non citizens at the expense of USA citizens who have worked hard, at considerable expense, and graduated from USA colleges. Let this country change its course and give USA citizens a helping hand.
Let's keep these jobs for hard working Americans, not foreigners!!!
As a parent of F1 student at USA, I strongly support the newly proposed rule on STEM extension. Obviously, it is a reasonable and clever policy. It will definitely be valuable in maintaining the best competitive in education of US University around world and be greatly helpful to both students getting working experience and America Economy attracting the talented persons.
What good reason do you have for doing this?  Everything I've read about this 'program' only harms the American working man and woman.  How do you plan on keeping track of these 'students'?  There is no way you can do that.  We have millions of our own citizens trying desperately to find jobs and are unable to do that.  The only ones to benefit from this, is large corporations.  For shame on anyone who is for this.In case you haven't heard, Social Security is already in trouble.  What this program does it rob SS of even more money.Again, for shame, for shame.Many Americans, myself included, already feel we're strangers in our own country.
There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree.The proposed "training improvements" circumvent hiring American workers at a competitive wage. They also end up compromising immigration laws as there is no effective system to monitor and control VISA holders length of stay.It is reported that many Americans with STEM degrees are not working in their specialties and the reasons for this should be explored,and understood prior to importing more competition in these fields.Big Tech lobbyists have spent millions seeking immigration increases; but Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are laying off American employees and there are reports that Disney is forcing terminatedAmerican workers to train their foreign hired replacements.None of these conditions support the need for the proposed rule; rather a reduction in the opportunities for work in the US for F-1 students seems more appropriate.
I believe this proposal is very meaningful for many companies hiring international students. It encourages the job market, and absorbs the high "talent" worker in U.S. I totally agree with this proposal. Hope this works!
We cannot afford this.keep Americans working.
I understand the DHS denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs over a 4 year period and removed $4 billion from Social Security and Medicare trust funds. We are putting foreign students before our own.  Foreign students do not want to become part of our country but want to bring their own laws and customs.  They want us to assimilate into their culture.  Why aren't these special mentoring programs open to Americans?  Our constitution will not be protected, our laws will not be enforced by the foreign population and we will not be American any longer.  Please do not allow this to happen. Not only does the DHS plan ensure that foreign born graduates take jobs from American college students it also categorizes the foreign born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. Also (OPT) Optional Practical Training givesemployers financial incentives to hire foreign students. Please do not play favoritism with our citizens.  This type of playingfavorites will backfire on our nation as a whole - increasing welfare and criminal activity because of job frustration.  This nation is on the brink of collapse because of a lack of common sense on the governments part.  This program needs to bescraped not expanded.  You cannot improve anything that is corrupt from its inception.
I studied mechanical engineering and mathematics in the 1950's and 1960's. I did not need more time after college to be trained. I was trained fully in my disciplines and I held full time, full work load jobs at a full salary. No intern period was required then for technical degreed people nor is it now. That is the nature of technical degrees in engineering and mathematics. It is also the case in most other sciences such as chemistry, biology, and physics. The only benefit from being able to hire foreign personnel is for large corporate structures to save money and for President Obama, the despot, to deliver on his promise to ruin the United States by putting American engineers on bread lines.No engineering student requires any time in training after she or he has secured a degree. This whole process is useless and is designed to allow big business and big government to screw Americans, again. Once the foreign person has secured his/her degree in the United States, send them home to pursue their careers. The USA has enough qualified engineers to fill any openings in any discipline any where in the country. And if that ever is not the case, then more US citizens will enter scientific and engineering colleges and universities to take advantage of the jobs available. It has always been thus.
Another example of the Government's deceitful subsidy and expansion of useless programs. Eliminating American workers from the labor force.  Adding nothing to the American safety net of citizens needing assistance.  Whoever designed this program should be fired.  We the people are getting smarter about Government by the Government instead of the People.  This is truly a good example of that. I as a voter will continue to educate my friends and  neighbors of the hazards bestowed on us by the Federal Government, and encourage them to do the same.
You must really hate the American people!  Another attack on the jobs available for American workers.   Our manufacturing jobs are all but gone because of this fantasy called FREE TRADE, you won't protect our own borders or enforce our immigration laws, more jobs lost.   And now this.  Is our Federal Government totally owned and controlled by Big Business?  Doesn't the future of young people in this country matter anymore?
Top Whom It May Concern:Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students is beyond reprehensible.  DHS has already put their hands in MY TILL by taking over $4 Billion of Social Security and Medicare trust funds.   In other words they have STOLEN MY BENEFITS to give to people who are NOT DESERVING. It is no wonder there will be no COLA again in 2016. Our COLA is going to corporate welfare as the employers don't pay FICA nor Medicare taxes because these "students" don't have to pay payroll taxes.  How absurd is that!  And DHS has denied over 430,000 Americans employment between 2009-2013 so that these so called "students" can have jobs.  That is being really loyal to your American citizen neighbors; friends and family.  How many of them could use $60,000-90,000 tax free money to support their families?  Oh, I forgot, they would have to pay all taxes so you can keep your tax funded job.  To even consider expanding this program is outrageous.  How do you sleep at night?  What is the legacy you are leaving your family members let alone your fellow American citizens?  SHAME ON YOU.
I agree with the expansion of opt time to 24 months for STEM student.
I strongly support this proposal as it will help fulfill human resource need of the country to some extent. International students will get valuable experience to help grow this country's economy. Please go ahead with this reform.
If the students is forced to leave US after one year OPT, it would be a loss for the company, since the former students is an experienced associate. Therefore, it is loss for the company because of the time and money devoted to train her and the time and money to recruit a new experience ones.As for the industry I am in, the IT auditor, it is valuable for the company to have an experienced staff and it is hard to recruit another experienced because as far as I know, my company, a big accounting firm ,spent two months to fill the experienced staff position regardless to say a senior position.In all, it would impact a lot of students who are now at the end of one year OPT. There are a lot of positions needed to be filled soon. by comparing the insufficient number of experienced people, the work of the company would slow down and the economy would also be impacted.
We absolutely do not need to give training to Illegal nonimmigrant Students.. NO Money, and No Training.   American citizens first.
I will strongly support this policy. It will definitely keep the workforce of the nation highly competitive. The policy will attract more talents as well.
I strongly recommend this proposed rule, This is a long awaited rule and should've been implemented much earlier. By allowing only 12 months of OPT it is not fair to the international students who have come from far countries in order to obtain most advanced information on technology and to get hands on experience . Retaining students who graduate from US universities will surely be a boost to the tech industry here rather than causing them to leave which is a Brain Drain. I saw some comments saying giving jobs to foreigners is corrupt and American students come first. Of course you are given priority before us. Have you ever wondered how tough it is to get a decent job and maintain status? Instead of saying we are foreigners why don't you check out where your ancestors are from? This is a nation built by immigrants. The land of the Free and home of the Brave. It will always be free to who ever wants to stay legally. You can show your anger towards the illegal immigrants. period.
I would like to say the actions of DHS is a direct slap in the face to most AMERICANS!  People who are born here need jobs and they need them now! Quit making it so easy to at the money I work for!
I oppose the Optional Practical Training (OPT) extension for students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).I am unable to obtain professional work for which I trained due to intense competition including competition from many non-citizens.  I earned BS in botany from Michigan State University, MS and PhD in plant pathology from Iowa State University, and later MS in statistics from University of Wisconsin--Madison.  I worked in agricultural research for 10 years and worked for 15 years in medical and health research.  I have publications in top journals (such as Archives of Ophthalmology affiliated with the Journal of the American Medical Association).  I have good references.  I lost my last professional job in January 2012 when all 3 of my closest coworkers were non-citizens, all in the process of renewing their visas.  I was top of my consulting class, the capstone class for the MS in statistics.  Much of my job competition comes from the 75% of my fellow statistics students who were non-citizens.  Faculty want to hire workers at 50% time to avoid paying benefits, or they want to hire full-time non-citizens avoiding payments for social security and avoiding payments for Medicare.  Hiring a non-citizen on a non-immigrant visa leaves the worker vulnerable so the hires will easily relinquish their right to authorship, another unfair attraction to employers.  The MS in statistics program has not changed appreciatively since I graduated in 2004, but I now have 10 years more experience than the current graduates.  I have good references from statisticians and medical research clients.  Yet, I now work at a Target store for $10 per hour while the university, corporations, and the news constantly repeat the claim of a shortage of workers trained in STEM.  I oppose subsidizing corporations or university programs by using tax money to train or import non-citizen STEM graduates to depress wages and promote age discrimination against US citizens.  Where is my bailout?
I would say that the OPT extension is only for the STEM international students. We should be aware of several facts here: 1. The percentage of the local US students and the unemployed US citizen of STEM is obviously much lower than the other fields. This means that even if we do not provide the OPT extension to those international students, It's not going to help anyway. Those unemployed US citizen or new graduates are competing much more with each other instead of with those international students. 2 Oppositely, If we do not extend the OPT which means there will be much less students working for the high tech companies (most of them they are US companies) at any point of time. Someone may argue that the H1-B are the same and it's nothing to do with the OPT, but you should also be aware of that if OPT is more 36 months which means even if he/she can not get an H1-B eventually, he/she can still work for those US companies for about 3 years which lead an optimized 3 times more students than what it is without the OPT extend. This will also do good to the US economy and then to other industries which are exactly what the US citizens and fresh graduates are looking for.In a word, the OPT extension is good for both the US government, the US citizens and the international students.
I would like to oppose the OPT rule because due this rule it invites lot of fraud process in the system. It helps lot of Indian INC companies i.e. companies with CEO'S mainly Indians to find an illegal way to cheat the system and i would like to tell you how and what is happening currently with lot of OPT students at least to 60% of students that are being currently recruited and placed. Please read it and understand the cheating that's happening right now: 1. The consultancy recruits OPT students by a simple process without an interview either by cold calling or by referrals and almost every company has a guest house where students are being accommodated providing food and shelter for a short period of time until they gets placed(yes i am referring to placed because even though you are recruited by the company you will be never paid until you get a contract job with client - as OPT have a rule that they can be given unpaid training every consultancy says that it is legal);. Upto this there is no big fraud or cheating that happening with the system from next step everything is illegal, unethical and unlawful.2. In the meanwhile he will be asked what kind of technology he is interested in and the consultancy will give guidance as in which technology has good job market billing rate and how he can easily get a job, will the job be easy or hard with fake experience etc. so then according to the nature the consultant/student selects the technology and consultancy will give training to consultant form then. Note: Please understand that the term training that i referred is not exact training way they will give to consultants/students. The trainer teaches basic concepts in technology and will mainly train he/she to how to survive in the job with 8-10 years of fake experience and will assure consultants that he will be taking the phone interview call for the consultant/student and will also makes a deal that he will be providing job support during consultant job which is unethical i.e. student after his office or during his office will either screen share or will be communicating his office work with trainer there by breaking the office confidentiality code. Trainer does the work for him according to consultant inputs for initial days until the consultant learns his work in his office. For this the trainer or the job backup will be paid hourly or monthly by the consultant. 2. Every consultant who have been hired in OPT will be given a sample fake resume after his training which has atleast 8-10 YEARS of experience to give him an idea how an experienced resume looks like and will be advised to make a resume that shall look like a sample fake resume that has been given to consultant. 3. The consultant/student in OPT agrees to it and then prepares a resume with fake resume which includes client names and company names, years that he has worked which in reality he has never worked on. Then the client names the he puts on the resume is carefully reviewed by consultancy and consultancy will make sure that at least first 2 clients that they put have some body in the client's location either full time or contractor that consultancy knows. The reason for that is to provide job reference when client recruiter asks about reference from his previous jobs  4. Then after the resume is prepared with fake years of experience with fake clients they which here the consultancy markets the resume with their marketing team with fake resumes. Thus the fake resume goes into markets with the consultant details and google voice number almost all the consultants will be advised to have a google voice number in their resume instead of personal numbers which is left to you to decide for what they are doing like that 5.So then the fake resume goes to a prime vendor where the vendor calls the consultant  to verify his job responsibilities, so now the consultant will be well prepared with his fake resume as in how to speak when a vendor calls, so when the vendor calls the consultant the consultant will keep his fake resume in front and talks to him in that fake resume way. Then if the vendor feels good in the phone then he will forward that to main client recruiter/manager. 6. So this is the main step, so when consultant gets the interview confirmation with client manager he then calls his back up or calls his consultancy to arrange a backup. So if it is a phone interview then the consultant will put a call forwarding to the backup resource who will be taking the call for the consultancy thus inviting unethical activity. SO the consultant will forward his fake resume and details to back up so that back up will speak to client manager accordingly and thus gets paid if the consultant gets a job after the interview call as he helped consultant which will be paid by consultancy. Then the consultant if selected will be sent to that client
This extension is very important for both US and International candidates as candidates bring great talent and US companies provide a great paltform.
I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness. So, Please think to one more time on increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 36 months instead of the current 17 months which can give enough time for students to utilize the education and can give maximum help in the growth on nation both technically and economically.
It is past time to make policy that ensures America , and Americans first when it come to employment I hail from inner city Detroit an OEM business. You folks in the federal governemnt have given away most of the manufacturing base of this country. This is just more misguided damage to America and Americans The answer is no time to curb immigration,and work visa's  sincerely Chris Savard
It seems that the OPT program for foreign STEM subject graduates is unfair discrimination against American citizens who are competing in the workplace as STEM graduates. Indeed, there are Americans in the STEM fields who are unemployed, possibly because of this unfiair program. Foriegn graduates can find mentoring in their own countries. Send them home and let them do so.
I fully support the new rule. This new rule will absolutely strengthen Unite States' leading position in technology. In addition, it will greatly improve the level of communication among highly talented people in STEM fields from all over the world. Beyond all doubt, it is a great move.
I support the new change made of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. It helps us to fully utilize the education we received.
It is definitely wrong to even consider hiring an immigrant non-citizen, regardless of their training or expertise, when so many of our qualified citizens can and desire to work and provide for themselves and those depending on them. I wouldn't hire anyone that wasn't  a citizen of the United States.This is not right nor should you be wasting your time and our money, even considering doing this. Instead you all should be doing all within your power to keep illegal aliens OUT. This intrusion into our country needs to be stopped and that should be your primary and only concern.Thank you for reading this as I definitely will be writing many letters, along with many of my friends, to have you busy doing something more constructive than helping those that are attempting to enter this country take our jobs for themselves. God bless you as you work and that you will be convicted that what you are doing is not patriotic when you get jobs for aliens and that it is WRONG!
NO DEAL!!!! LET'S HELP PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO PAY TAXES. STOP HELPING THE WORLD BECAUSE SURE ARE NOT HELPING US.
Enough BS. Let's  start taking care of Americans first. This crap is going to be remembered in Nov of 2016
This is utter nonsense! We have unemployed American citizens who have paid taxes to support our government and you are caving in to special interests who use unneeded foreign workers while they lay off Americans who can do the jobs they say they need workers for. This undermines American workers and pay scales and is poor policy that should be ended.
I want the extension for OPT. Thanks so much.
It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates to find work and this proposed rule would make  it it even more difficult by adding un-necessary job competition to the mix.I am opposed to this proposed rule change.
I am supportive.
That's an awesome policy! With this policy international student in STEM major can stay longer in US, and have more possibility to get work visa. Since local candidates can't always meet the STEM related companies job requirement and quantity, this policy could help them get sufficient talent employees, and create more jobs for local people(think about Uber).  What's more, nowadays many international students have great ideas and want to run start-ups themselves. But they are always stopped by only 1 year of OPT and concern of visa sponsorship. Now they have more time to try their ideas and manage business to qualify the H-1B visa requirement for self-employed. Overall, this policy could help US companies to get more talent employees, and may lead to more new companies and more jobs, which benefit local people.
Flooding the STEM fields with cheap workers is not a reasonable solution for any perceived shortage. Studies have shown that there not a shortage of STEM workers, but rather a they are actually undervalued by companies who do not want to pay a reasonable wage for their services. Extending the OTP program plays into this desire to pay low wages and increase competition in a field already dominated by people willing to work cheaply for the sole purpose of staying in the country. The OPT program is used to circumvent the H-1B requirements, minimal as they are.The OPT and H-1B program are also used by companies to offshore jobs. It is in the best interest of the government to keep jobs in the United States to increase the tax base and keep it's citizens employed. the vast majority of jobs that go off shore never come back.I sincerely hope that ICE and the DHS drop the idea of expanding the OPT program and return it to it's original levels, or drop the program altogether. There are already plenty of programs that can be used to keep exceptional foreign students in the country. The OPT program isn't necessary or warranted.
Fully support the new rule. If you think this rule sabotages the employment of Americans, please take a look at the jobs these STEM international students have and also the unemployment cases. There's no direct causality inbetween. Numerous highly skilled immigrants contributed to the US in the past decades. Now attracting and retaining international students in math, science, engineering and technology is important to keep the nation competitive and strong. I highly support the new OPT extension rule.
I guess this would really help US to utilize the international skills in its development.
I am very happy with the fact that DHS came up with better rules this time in order to benefit OPT STEM students. However, I feel that the mandatory rule that requires employers to provide training and mentorship to STEM student might backfire for firms that have very little resources. I honestly feel that in a real world environment there are cases when students should be able to learn on the job by themselves. I believe that DHS should not include this rule because it might prevent employers to hire OPT STEM students because of this. On the bright side, DHS proposal to increase the STEM opt to 24 months is a welcome change. It will enable the students have better chance to qualify for h1b lottery as they will have more chances.
This is just another way of keeping Americans out of work.  You already have enough immigrants to take jobs away but that is not good enough for evil people like you.  You will be a supporter of this NWO and depopulation and carry out this evil agenda that obummer is pushing.  All government is against the people, plain as day.
Are you out of your fucking mind.  How beneficial is an entry-level employee?  This kills American STEM grads.
This should not be implemented:By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.The proposed regulations are "irresponsible and dangerous" considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'Thank You.
This is a great proposal. It helps both current F-1 students, and more importantly, all business that are hiring F-1 students, as we all know a large percentage of STEM workers are foreign.Please allow the extension from 17-month to 24-month automatic for current 17-month OPT-STEM holder, since it would reduce the overhead for both the students and USCIS. Otherwise, on Feb 13, 2016, if the rule becomes effective, there could potentially be a huge number of applications, even more so than the H1B petitions.
WHY has the Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule to expand a   program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers   financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans, given the  sickeningly high US unemployment and abysmally low economic recovery   figures???  I am against such a disgraceful attempt to hurt Americans  financially.  Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more   than 120,000 young, foreign, college graduates per year who hold F-1   visas - FORCE Americans out of the computer science field and creates   a FALSE, self-fulfilling, so-called 'shortage' of STEM workers in America.  OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to   a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign   labor in lieu of Americans. The proposed rule of adding 24 months of   discrimination against Americans effectively entices and allows   employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status   discrimination. Why is the Obama administration's DHS so bent on hurting   American citizens, with DHS's OPT ?
I am supportive of the new rule regarding the 24-month OPT extension for STEM students, but I am also urging them to extend this further for 24 + 24 months extension. Although this rule will substantially reduces the losses of contributing foreign employees for US companies and also ensures that employers to continuously provide high technology and healthcare to American citizens. In addition, this rule will encourage future foreign students in the STEM field to perform scientific research in the US universities.  which is not only financially beneficial to US universities, but also to adds cultural diversity and intellectual properties to the US universities.
Dear ICEB:Your proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) is appalling breach of trust with the American people.That program is being pushed by greedy US executives who want a flood of cheap young workers so that they can depress wages.There is no tech worker shortage.  There is only a shortage of US companies who want to pay honest rates for talent.Read this: https://normsaysno.wordpress.com/2015/10/20/dhs-unabashedly-biased-in-its-new-opt-proposal/
I strongly support this rule. I completed my PhD in electrical engineering from University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and I am working in a reputed company but my H-1B application did not get selected in the lottery last year. This rule would definitely help me, and it can even further help my wife who was also not selected at H-1B lottery this year. Her OPT STEM extension expires in December 2015 and I was hoping this rule, which gives her 7 more months of OPT, will be implemented sooner allowing her to have one more chance at H-1B. I would like to further suggest changing this rule in a way such that people like my wife who will potentially be in the 60-day grace period after expiration of OPT status (Feb 2015 for my wife) would also be able to use this extension. This will give them another chance to apply for H-1B and keep contributing to American economy. My wife was awarded her master's degree in a microbiology-molecular biology combined program from University of Minnesota- Twin Cities and she is currently working as a scientist in a leading diagnostic company. She works on projects that will be making real difference for patients not just in America but all over the world. She would have to stop working in December even though she has a published thesis and years of experience. Only other alternative we have is both of us leave US and rebuild our future elsewhere. Another reason that this rule should be implemented as soon as possible is the number of applications submitted for H-1B are getting higher and higher (more than 220,000 in 2015). This leads to a significant decrease in the chances of students, who have spent years here studying and honing their skills, getting a H-1B visa. It is difficult to understand the point of sending away highly skilled workers who were educated here and are already well-versed and immersed with the US culture, and instead bringing in lesser skilled foreign educated workers every year though H-1Bs. Especially the students who spent more than 5 years doing PhD in US having to go back to their home countries because of this is just not a fair system. In current rule, a student can receive one 24-months extension and can get another 24-months extension if he/she pursues and completes a higher STEM degree. This makes it unfair for students who are pursuing PhD. Once they are done with their degree, they can only get one extension as there is no higher degree to pursue. This rule should allow the students who have completed PhD degree to take two 24 months extension if they have not taken any previous extension.
I DONT WANT FOREIGN STEM WORKERS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THSI COUNTRY ANYMORE. WE ARE OVERHWLMED WITH THESE FOREIGNERS CMOING HERE AND TAKING JOBS FOR LESS MONEY THAN AMERICAN WORKERS. KEEP THEM ALL OUT. SHUT DOWN ALL PROGRAMS THAT BRING IN FOREIGN WOERKERS. MAKE EVERY JOB AN AMERICAN JOB. AND STOP THE BIG COROPORATIONS FROM BUILDING PLANTS IN MEXICO TO EXPORT AMERICAN JOBS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR. IF YOU SELL IT I NAMERICAN MAKE IT IN AMERICA. STOP THIS EXPORT OF AL THAT M,ADE3 AMERICA A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE. WE ARE OVERWWHELMED WITH FOREIGNERS HERE. ALL IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS HSOULD  BE SHUT DOWN. ALL ILLEGAL  IMIGRANTS SHOULD BE QUICKLY DEPORTED FROM THE USA. W ENEE DTO TO TO ALL THESE CORPORATIONS AND BUSINESSES THAT ARE HIRIGN FOREIGN WOKERS AND FORCE THEM TO FIRE ALL ILLEGAL WORKERS. WE ARE EING DEVOURED IN THIS COUNTRY WITH FOREIGNERS TNEAKING IN HERE. OVERSTAYING THEIR VISAS.

HE SEEM TO HATE AMERICA. HE SEEM TO HATE THE AMERICANS WHO LIVE HTRE.
I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. It doesn't make any sense to make them leave after graduation. We provide a valuable education and make them bright students and let them leave to create business opportunities on other countries? Instead we should keep the talent within the county and give them a chance to create more opportunities within the nation.  But, this new rule putting more responsibilities on the employer who is gonna hire a OPT student in terms of providing a proof related to training and mentoring etc... Its kind of discouraging the employer to hire a OPT student. I believe, there should be some changes in that aspect. Finally, I really appreciate the rule and support it.
It is good for all the stem extension so I support it completely
I strongly support this rule.I believe the extension from 17 to 24 months will strengthen the power of US science and technology and boost US economy in the long run.
Improving and Expanding OPT is a great chance for those STEM students like me to gain more work experiences at USA. I'm very happy to support this new rule.

As a growing company trying to education young US students in advanced STEM fields, I feel that the OPT extension allows us to hire talent to pass forward to our students.I am a huge supporter of keeping the OPT extension period and increasing it to 24 months.
I strongly agree with this policy. The economy of US will be hurt if it cancel the OPT.
I want the stem extension to 24 months
As a 4 year university degree in electrical engineering, almost 5 years in the US military, 25+ years working in the industry I have seen a tremendous disparity, disappointment in the idea of "The American Dream"Being unemployed or underemployed for at least a 1/3 of my working career due to having to train a foreigner on US soil to attempt to do my job more than a few times is quite disheartening - only to be lied to usually with the line "hey this will create more &amp; better jobs for all of you), only to be standing in the unemployment line the next dayI have never been arrested, never been convicted of a crime, I speak 3 other languages (Mandarin, German &amp; Arabic) other than English, I don't drink, smoke, party, I am a workaholic, strong work ethic, etc...But what does corporate America do, they through people like me, Joe public under the bus so they can claim they are more competitive, they wine &amp; dine the politicians American citizens voted into office only to be stabbed in the back
<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>MORE lunacy from this government of complete traitors. Jobs should go to Americans and only Americans. Not to any person who is in this country illegally. No matter what Obama has to say.
With Millions of American citizens and American students out of a job, and are looking for one,  this proposal is a disgrace to all.   We need to put our own citizens needs first, and if there are any opportunities left over, then we can bring in more workers.
I think international students play an important role in US's working force, and will become more and more important.  It is fair and reasonable to extend OPT, so as to benefit the country's economy
This rule is vital for all the international students in USA and will be encouraging their hard efforts put on acquiring their masters degree from world reputed universities here. I strongly support this initiative.
OPT is benefit for both USA and international students. As we all know, USA has the most advanced technology and the best university in the world, which attracts the most talented people to study or work. Young international students,who mostly are the most hardworking and smartest people in their home country, have the most creative ideas, which can do a huge progress in area of high  technology. These idea will be implemented by creating a company or create a new program in some company, which means it will bring huge working opportunity for US citizens. As we all know, there are many international students whose major are "stem" in high-tech company. And they do a great job in company which can bring huge profit to their company and it will reflect in the GDP of USA. Realizing the 24 extension of OPT will have a great effect on the development of USA.
Allowing students to be employed under OPT with the STEM extension is a fantastic benefit for the United States and its economy. These are the students that come to the United States and study inside the country, and get degrees inside the country. They are a value asset that the US invested in. These students want to invest back into the country. From my experience, they all look for jobs in the same way as any other American citizen does, they go through absolutely the same interview process and are exposed to the same benefits as American citizens - the wage difference is a myth that is being perpetuated by parties not familiar with the subject. There is no problem with "fairness" - every single international student goes through the same exact process as any American to get employed, but with ten times more restrictions. Whoever mentioned that it is just a matter of hiring foreign workers for cheap labor is, once again - not aware of the process to get a work authorization. Coming to the United States on an F-1 visa, pay out-of-state tuition, combined with international fees, limited amount of on and off-campus employment, restrictions for work hours - all these are the things international students are already going through that no American student does. If on top of that, they are passionate and talented enough to apply for high-skill jobs, and get them - America cannot afford to lose those students.The future Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs - all of them are there. Every single international STEM student that I got the honor to meet over the past couple of years showed tremendous work ethic, dedication and most of all - appreciation for what the United States has to offer. These are the people that gave up on a lot to come to the US and study - study in fields that are by no means trivial. Major innovators in this country were all immigrants or descendants of immigrants - it's time we look past someone's origin and more at their abilities and willingness to do great work.United States was always known as a global economy. This country has more impact worldwide than any other nation. This means that to maintain that status, we need global talent. Enrollment in STEM degrees goes up, but graduation rates in the same areas do not. Every year there is a fixed number of students with advanced degrees that graduate, but not nearly at a fast enough rate to fill all positions. There is an extremely high-demand for top-skill jobs that are going unfilled. Not because of wages, but because of lack of skilled enough individuals. This is why it should be US' top interest to ensure that it can retain those who have those skills, and more so - grew those skills at universities across the country.I urge you to pass this legislation to ensure that United States remains a country that can innovate and produce technology that benefits the entire world.
Is it not time for our congress and executive stood up for the citizens. The illegals now have more advantage then the citizens WHO PAY TAX AND THE SALARY TO THE CONGRESS AND THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (PRESIDENT AND HIS STAFF).  This is a sad day for our citizens and the worthless congress and president we have.
This proposal by the DHS to extend the OPT to 24 months is yet another slap in the face to American technologists.I remember distinctly in the 1960s and '70s, the worries of my father, an electronic engineer, over possibly being laid off and being unable to find employment at competitive wages for a man in his 40s to 50s.The OPT extension is essentially the same thing only applied to the opposite end of the age range.If DHS really is in the alleged business of "Homeland Security", let it start by protecting qualified technologists from foreign invasion.If DHS is unable or unwilling to do so, perhaps the personnel of DHS can be replaced by foreigners as well.
That's very great for STEM International students!
That's very great for STEM International students!
This will be a great policy that helps the educated international students bring their professionals to the country. The extension on OPT period gives more opportunities to the international students to get selected by the H1B lottery. This also secure the employer company so that they won't worry about dropping good candidate who may has been well trained by the employer.
The Department of Homeland Securit! y has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over AmericansReally!! The federal government of the USA is giving incentives to corps. to hire NON US CITIZENS graduates over AMERICAN CITIZEN graduates.UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!Well, NOT REALLY when you look at all the other ANTI-AMERICAN incentives/laws put forth from this administration.PLEASE, go find your BRAIN, you really need it???!!!!
It is ludicrous and borders on the insane to keep importing foreign laborers when millions of our Americans are out of work and can't even find a job.  Let's hire our own people first--there are many out there and would love to get that job rather than let a foreigner get.Therefore, I most adamantly oppose this program
It is hard to believe a federal agency would have a rule that puts immigrant students ahead of USA students for STEM job opportunities.  That rule is a disgrace.  I would like to see whoever is responsible for the rule, and whoever helped to make this rule, fired for incompetence with a undesirable job recommendation.To offset this incompetence, the new rule should require all employers seeking job applicants to do a national search for several months.  The job search should be done by a national company that is totally separate from the government.  Only after this search fails to find someone, can a employer look for an immigrant.  The prospective employer will then have to submit endless volumes of paperwork to the government to justify seeking to hire an immigrant.  The government is very good at making endless volumes of worthless paperwork.  This would encourage employers to look closer for a student form here.  Then, that immigrant must be paid the same wage that the citizen would be paid.  The government should then do something to make students from here more attracted to STEM jobs, something like, paid off student loans after working for several years (6-10) in a STEM field.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>
As an employer/manager of foreign nationals currently on a STEM extension because of pending H1-B applications, I enthusiastically support this proposal and urge for it to be made a part of our nation's policies.
I'm sure you have heard all the reasons, at least once. The only thing I have to say about it is  AMERICA &amp; AMERICANS FIRST AND ALWAYS.........
The expanded OPT program will:Allow most participants to pays NO money into Social Security or Medicare;Take hundreds of thousands of American jobs and hands them to foreigners; Fail to require employers to pay the prevailing (usual) wage. This is not good for American Workers!
It is a great news for F-1 students. We do need this.
By hiring foreign students, corporations are not paying 7.5% into the federal coffers for each paycheck. This means ONE BILLION DOLLARS shortfall for Medicare and Social Security programs PER YEAR. This bill is a shadow bill launched by the President to circumvent the wishes of Congress and the wishes of many citizens. Existing taxpayers/workers are training immigrants to take their jobs. I.E Disney World.The proposals are presented as humanitarian, yet buckles to corporate interests over the needs of seniors who paid into a system all of their lives. There is little if any training going on in these corporations. It is all about cheap labor. The students are supposedly going back to their native countries to spread their knowledge. Oh please, do you really belief this malarkey for a moment? Sounds like a bad used car salesperson. Many immigrant students on work visas overstay. Some apply for citizenship or just blend in without paying into the system. However, they use our social services and medical systems that they never paid for. Great deal for them. Lousy deal especially for seniors that have waited a lifetime to feel a little more secure. MILLIONS 60+ lost their jobs during the great recession. Just another scam and an end run to hide the truth.My biggest mistake ever was voting for Obama. He is acting like a King, not a President. Biggest sell-out of American workers ever. I want my country back. There will be a wave of former Democrats voting Republican next year do to this favoritism. Why is it that foreign workers have an extra advantage over citizens that built the system that they so much are taking advantage of? I am STRONGLY against immigrant bashing. But I believe everyone should wait in line for citizenship and quit asking for, and getting, a special advantage. Fairness used to be the American way. Now we expose ourselves as saps to the world. Human nature takes over and the abuse begins. We don't have the money anymore. PLEASE WAKE UP!!!
I completely support the proposal to increase STEM extension period from 17 months to 24 months. The nation would greatly benefit from this as it would help in economic and technological progress.
"Please add "Doctor of Dental Medicine, DMD and Doctor of Dental Surgery, DDS to the STEM degree list"
This seems like a great opportunity. US and students have a lot to gain from this extension.
I am supporting the new 24 months OPT-STEM extension for F-1 Nonimmigrant students.
This is so great!I think this will definitely help me a lot.It can be better if the extension can be longer.
Stop the STEM so that foreigners stay in this country longer while employers do not pay taxes.
Please stand up for American workers and do not expand the Optional Practical Training program because it would hurt American workers. Thank you.
the newly modified policy about extending STEM related international students to work legally for 24 months is awesome if it can be approved by the immigration government.  Personally, the US is a country with diverse ethnicities, which is the origin of its foundation and motivation.  The American Dream is to let every one with talented skills can compete fairly in the related fields.  It's because of the diversity and inclusive that shapes America as it is today.  I just want to say the extension policy will greatly benefit American people, because it saves lots of talents in many areas from rushing into other countries.  In the long run, it's a win-win policy for both American people and our international students.
The OPT program has been a tried and tested way of bringing in and keeping talent within the United States of America. The OPT has been the reason why the US is the first choice among Chinese and Indian students seeking to further their skills and contribute to the Tech industry.It is beneficial for the US IT Industry as well, as they are able to hire strong talent for a lower pay. Without the OPT extension, companies would start to lose talent and will end up paying a lot more for sub standard talent. I believe the 24 month extension is vital for the sustenance and growth of the US Tech sector.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.Sen. Charles Grassley, in a letter to President Obama, stated:"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent." I agree wholeheartedly.OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.The proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it. The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers. Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? There is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates. U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000. DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly. If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.Not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. A 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.The worker protections included in the new rule "are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.They do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, they chase Americans out of computer science and they create a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields."To summarize, this proposed rule is so ill-advised that it needs to be totally scrapped. We need programs for putting Americans to work, not programs like this that give American jobs to cheap foreign labor.
I support the STEM extension. The U.S. shouldn't let those high demanded talents go away.
I support the STEM extension. The U.S. shouldn't let those high demanded talents go away.
The OPT proposed rule change is illegal and counter-productive.  In its' first 5 years, OPT cost 430,000 American jobs and cut $4 Billion out of Social Security and Medicare.This OPT program favors foreign workers over Americans.  That is inherently wrong, when we have a shortage of STEM jobs for our own citizens.  Employers save 7.65% by hiring foreign workers.  These foreigners are paid $60-$90,000 per year, and, because they don't pay payroll taxes, it costs Social Security $1 Billion each year.  This is unjust to American taxpayers.If you add OPT-12 and OPT-29 workers to existing F-1 student workers, almost 700,000 jobs are already filled by foreign workers in an economy that has 94,000,000 unemployed or under-employed Americans.This OPT program is already out of control.  Don't make it worse.
That's great.US need such guys work for us.
I agree we this previous comment: "I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens." Please reject this proposal to expand the optional training program as it does nothing to protect American workers.
This is just another example of a well-meaning program that has been hijacked and perverted by opportunists. When are you people going to wise up?
Living in San Diego and have an 18 yo son who still cannot find an entry level job anywhere. he has even applied to fast food chains despite feeling uncomfortable working there because he was the only non-hispanic english -speaking youth. Now looking for over 13 months. As a result of the constant rejection he has become quit hopeless and depressed. He is a good kid with morals, polite, well-spoken, integrity, clean-cut, and with good grades. He is giving up because he just does not know what to do anymore to get a break.
Opt extension is very important for international students who have technical skills.
I strongly oppose the expanded proposed rule!!!
This OPT extension is very important for both students,employees and employers ,I strongly hope the OPT 24months extension can be approved.
One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity. Most of the F-1 students (specially with advanced degrees) have solid technology background and are very hard-working. Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. A great example should be the new Google's CEO Sundar Pichai who leaded the team to develop Google Chrome which not only helped Google earns huge amount of profit but also drove a tremendous increase in US tech industry. As we all know, Sundar was one of the F-1 nonimmigrant students about twenty years ago. The F-1 nonimmigrant students cases also applied to Satya Nadella who is the current CEO of microsoft. Also, improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.In conclusion, this suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
Americans should be priority for tech jobs or any jobs. Lets not allow the undercutting of wages or people from other countries that are not more qualified for jobs to get those jobs. We have too many unemployed to be allowing our jobs to be given away to others. The only time we should be giving jobs to a foreigner is if we can't find an American to do the job.
Please refer to the attachment
The rule seems nice. Went through the entire rule and felt like it is a win-win game for everyone(Employers, Employees(US and international) and International Students). Hope this will be seen implemented exactly this way in coming months.
I seriously believe that elongate the OPT extension would greatly enhance the input of high tech industry in U.S. This would attract more talented students oversea to come study and contribute to the prosperity of the U.S.A.
This looks like a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.I am opposed to it.
I am writing to request that the proposed changes to this regulation be eliminated.   We need to use our American workers instead of importing foreign workers to take the available jobs.  We have far too many legal and illegal workers in this country now.   If a foreigner chooses to get an education in this country, that is fine (if they pay for it).   However, that should not be a doorway to staying here when the education is completed.
There should be a rule to include master of business administration degree in the extended OPT. There are so many students who have an undergrad in STEM back in their home country ( a conventional 4 year degree in ENGINEERING, MATH, TECHNOLOGY and SCIENCE) . Since MBA does not qualify for the OPT extension ,a lot of bright students with STEM undergrad who are seeking to work as entry level managers in technology companies in US are loosing out in the H1B lottery system. Providing an extended OPT for people with STEM degrees from foreign Universities would help students add value to the US economy.
Simply unbelievable to me that foreign born workers would be given preferential treatment over American workers. Who thinks this up anyway and how is this meant to help American workers. At 50 years old, I was fired from Cummins Engine Co. and replaced with foreign born engineers. I am an excellent engineer, hold two patents, a copyright, and provided documented cost savings to Cummins in excess of $30,000,000.00. I have recently heard from a Cummins engineering manager, that over 75% of the engineers at Cummins are foreign born. My family has been in this country since the 1600's, I have six 4th of 5th great-grandfathers that fought in the Revolutionary War. Harry Truman is a cousin and to think we are treated this way is an abomination.Sincerely,Chip Truman
Hire American citizens for jobs! Stop trying to undercut American workers by giving a bonus to foreign workers.
I would like our government to protect the American people for once.  Stop putting immigrants' interest before our own citizens!
This is definitely  designed to hurt American workers and give financial incentives to hire foreign workers instead of US workers. We don't need this or an increase in H1B workers. I have worked to IT for over 35 years and I know that Americans are NOT given consideration when lower wage foreign workers are available. This results in discrimination and discourages US workers from working in STEM fields.
I believe this new policy will greatly benefit the United States. We need to keep these talented individuals rather than sending them back home to compete against us. They can grow our economy and create more jobs.
This is another example of administration circumvention of the intent of the laws passed by the legislative branch. The initial program was bad enough but the expansion proposed only worsens the opportunity for US citizen STEM employees to find employment.  The labor participation rate is now equal to the late 1970's and this is another program that will lessen it even more and targeted against the younger workers.
The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.    The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.    The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.    I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
This is bad for the American worker.
We are voting to approve the 24 months of stem
It is unconscionable to make it advantageous for US companies to hire foreigners over US workers.OPT is meant to be a temporary training program and not a bridge to long-term work visa or a way for US companies to hire cheaper foreign labor over Americans.OPT workers cost Social Security about $1B a year. This is not  wise for the US.It is wrong for OPT to remove billions of dollars from Social Security and Medicare.There are millions of unemployed/under-employed Americans. US companies need to hire Americans first.OPT is un-American.
This is obviously another attack on the American economy and should not be considered good for the average citizen.Continued abuse of our laws and the intent of same keep the wage of the average worker depressed, and are destroying our country.

<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>DHS "is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment."<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers)."<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program."WHEN, WHEN WILL AMERICAN CITIZENS BE PROTECTED BY OUR GOVERNMENT?JUST ANOTHER NASTY CHEAP TRICK PLAY ON AMERICAN CITIZENS.WHEN WILL THIS NONSENSE EVER END?
OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.  We must take care of our own citizens first.  It is amazing to me how President Obama tells students to stay in school when the economy is depressed, and at the same time offer incentives to companies to hire foreigners.  These positions should be available for our people when they finish their educations.
Being a student myself, graduating from MIT and having used the OPT program, I am amazed at how hard US makes from top talent to keep working in the country. USA has one of the most restrictive and unfriendly policies when it comes to hiring talent from foreign students in US universities. I have hundreds of my friends ( phDs, MBAs, scientists from US universities etc) who left the country as they were not able to get a H1B. All of them are doing great elsewhere - only one has lost - the US economy.  It make sense that they would want to restrict people move directly to work here from abroad, but students who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollar and time going through the education process deserve much better.
I support the proposed titled "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students". In particular, I strongly agree with the following provisions of the proposed rule:1.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Increasing the total period of the OPT STEM extension to 24 months. Students on a STEM extension are usually hired in specialty occupations. Training a new employee and entrusting them with responsibilities takes a substantial amount of time. If students are to contribute and gain real experience, a longer time period is necessary, and 24 months is appropriate to make a substantial impact, and kickstart a student's career.2.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The safeguards for US workers, and prevailing wage requirements alleviate concerns of STEM OPT students taking over jobs that would otherwise be obtained by US workers.3.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The mentoring and training plan requirements ensures that students will actually be employed by an employer that can provide the required guidance, training, and mentoring that they need during their early career phase.4.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The additional STEM extension is welcome news for students who are interested in working for a few years to gain practical experience before going back to school. The single OPT STEM extension per lifetime rule was overly restrictive, especially since many students go back to earn a higher degree level, and continue to contribute to the industry.5.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>School accreditation and site visits are crucial to ensure that students don't simply enroll in unaccredited schools with lax enrollment guidelines for the sole objective of obtaining work authorization.6.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Increasing the allowed period of unemployment to 150 days is a welcome relief, since the job search process is extremely stressful, unpredictable, and time consuming.This rule provides substantial economic, academic, and cultural benefits to the United States, as specified in section IV. C. of the proposed rule. As stated in section IV. C. 2, it is important for the US to continue retaining high skilled foreign graduates ahead of other countries that may prove to be more viable destinations if the legal immigration system in the US proves to be too restrictive, cumbersome, or otherwise unfriendly to high skilled foreign graduates.While the rule makes some good proposals, we would also appreciate clarity on the following topics of contention:1.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The effects of a final rule not being in place by Feb. 13, 2016 on students who already have approved STEM extensions.2.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Whether a higher degree in a non STEM field is grounds for a second 24 months STEM extension.Finally, I also suggest that students who have been on the OPT extension for a period of time be considered dual intent, and file for a green card without it having negative repercussions on future F1 visa applications.Sincerely,Anurag Bhatt
Stop all Visa extensions.  The USA has millions unemployed/underemployed STEM workers.  Allowing visa extensions depresses wages and keeps new college graduates from even getting jobs.  My own daughter has a Biology degree and was forced to take an admin job because of unfettered immigration and the importing of foreign workers.
I believe the expansion of the F-1 non-immigrant students with stem degrees is a very bad idea for a large number of Americans. The Center for Immigration studies indicates that 430,000 Americans were unable to find work between 2009 and 2013  due to the existing program for these F-1 students. Also, because these students were not Americans, Medicare and Social Security lost out on collecting approximately four billion dollars during this same time period. Both of these programs are in severe need. Why exacerbate it? If the idea is to be more competitive, then we should focus on providing American college graduates in stem fields every opportunity to find work. Not drive them away from it due to favoritism to foreign nationals. So it seems, this proposed rule will hurt the young and old alike. It will make it more difficult for a college graduate to find work, and it will hurt retired Americans. How is this a good thing if we are concerned about middle class Americans in any way shape or form. There must be some select set of individuals who would benefit greatly from this. I am not referring to the foreign nationals, but to rich and influential Americans.
I think it's a good news. Expanding Training Opportunities is good for the company and the students, which can provide more training to the students while the company can create more profit through the new graduate students. Although some people may think this policy would increase unemployment rate of the citizen, in fact the majority of unemployment is not the market that F-1 students focus on.
As the President has highlighted the importance of knowledge based sectors to the economy, it is highly imperative that the polices and regulations are consistent with his thoughts. International students majoring in STEM have huge potential in contributing to the economy. The OPT STEM is a perfect program to realize it. Economists have reported time and again the benefits these highly skilled individuals bring to the native population. They are more likely to start a business and generate jobs, they work in high tech industries that are at the forefront of innovations. In short, they help in keeping the US economy at the front. These students bring business to the economy in terms of tuition and living expenditure to the universities and municipals. At times when college enrollment for native population is at an all time low, these students fill in the void and make sure that these institutions of higher learning are afloat.I fully support the expansion of the STEM OPT program from the current 29 to 36 months. As the DHS mentioned in its draft rule, it should provide guidance if at all the rule making process is not completed before February 12th, 2016.   The executive action is indeed a temporary measure to solve the impact of our broken immigration system. At the same time, I request the DHS to advocate and continuously press the legislature to pass common sense immigration laws.
What gives the federal government the right promote discrimination against its citizens and steal their labor "for the good of the nation"?Back in 2007 I was forced, through workplace harassment, to resign a position I had for over 10 years so a recent foreign graduate could remain in the U.S.  The work was not STEM at all.  It was web development for an insurance company's marketing division.I'm called a myth by politicians like Schumer who doesn't represent me and denigrates me as a "privileged elite" not deserving of any rights.I'd like an explanation why I shouldn't view the federal government as a terrorist group pursuing their own throat-cutting agenda.  It certainly took more from me than any ISIS member I'm supposed to view as the enemy ever did.
I strongly support this proposal. Extending STEM OPT to 24 months will surely benefits both international students and large companies.
This rule will be a big relief for all who have F1 visa...it will be open options for them and also for companies. I strongly support this rule.
This is essential for United states to attract foreign students to pursue higher education in America. This is a significant advantage that United states has over Europe which makes it a suitable location to pursue further education for students especially from the developing nations. I would recommend making this OPT extension 36 months to give the students time to properly apply their education and making foreign students a viable candidate for companies who are looking to hire young people with passion and expertise in their field of study.
This OPT Program must not be expanded. It should be ended completely.  It is taking American jobs and giving them to foreign nationals at the expense of American workers.  Further, it is robbing the Social Security System and Medicare System of needed income tax revenues.  What idiot thought this was a good idea to begin with?  It must end!
Please stop the OPT program extension as this is a terrible overreach of our government.
It's a great news for student in the OPT period and hope this proposal could be passed.
Extending STEM optional practical training to total of 3 years definitely helps a lot to both applicants themselves but also big companies in US. Applicants can gain more experience related to their major and contribute their part to US companies to get stronger with the up to date knowledge from school. This new policy will attract more genius from all over the world to America I do believe.
American employers are all ready abusing this program to the detriment of American workers.  Just look at what Disney is doing to American workers as one example of the abuses that are all ready occurring.  America cannot afford this de facto run around of our immigration laws.  It's time to put American workers first, not big business and the Chamber of Commerce who desire cheap labor, free from obamacare taxes and payroll taxes, over American workers.  I agree with and concur with the following statements and quotes from Senator Charles Grassley:Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."the proposed regulations are "irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.""The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'""After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.""OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans."John Miano, attorney representing tech workers:the proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.""The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit."David North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department:"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.""U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.""DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.""If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate."
I am a foreign national currently working under the STEM OPT 17 month extension. I got my masters degree in Engineering from a large public university. I learnt a great deal during my schooling in the US and had the good fortune to be taught by world renowned scientists. I remember towards the end of my degree, I along with few other grad students and post-docs were attending a meeting to review recent research results from a visiting professors lab. We had unending questions about the results and were politely but relentlessly questioning the visiting professor. My professor proudly pointed to us and said to the visiting professor "look at how critical these young researchers are of the material you presented, they don't accept the material at face value and have learned to think like scientists". I realized at that moment that slowly, without even realizing it, under the careful, critical and tireless tutelage of my professors, my mind had finally opened and begun to process information like a scientists' should. After graduating, I applied for the OPT visa and started working at a company that manufactures very complex scientific equipment. My master's thesis was based on this equipment and this role provided me the opportunity to understand more about the physics, applications and inner workings of this technology. I know for a fact that I had not displaced any US citizens by taking up my current job and this position was open for months before I applied and was hired. My educational background, engineering skills and aptitude have proven to be very valuable for the company I work for and I have been a highly contributing employee thus far.  I have had very supportive and experienced mentors who have continuously trained and guided me. I have learnt more working alongside my fellow engineers than I could have learnt in a university setting. Moreover many of the soft skills that I picked up at my job are the foundation of having a successful lifelong career in engineering. I learned to apply my skills in an environment where teamwork, dealing with customers, collaborators and outside competition was just as important as getting the right answers. Having the 12 months OPT and 24 months STEM extension in my opinion is absolutely crucial for engineering roles where technologies evolve so quickly that what is learned in universities is outdated by the time we graduate. Internships do help in getting some practical experience but to become an effective engineer we need to be involved in developing enterprise scale projects which take years of continuous effort. Internships generally provide opportunities to work on small projects that can be completed in 3-6 months.Unfortunately my 17 month OPT period ends in mid-December and it seems unlikely that the 24 month STEM extension rule would be finalized before then. I urge you to please consider allowing students who have recently completed their 17 month STEM extension and are currently in their 60 day grace period to apply for the balance 7 months extension. Though I have learnt a great deal about one instrument, my training is still incomplete and I have not even begun to get trained on the highly complex equipment we supply to synchrotron labs around the world. This rule would provide students like me an invaluable opportunity to complete projects we started working on years ago. Though I have learnt a great deal about one instrument, my training is still incomplete and I have not even begun to work on the highly complex equipment we supply to synchrotron labs around the world. If I had to suddenly leave, my company would have to scramble to hire someone in my place. The projects I am working on could be delayed for months before someone with suitable skills and experience can be found and brought up to speed. This rule would provide students like me an invaluable opportunity to complete projects we started working on years ago. Many thanks for your time and consideration.
As an engineer I work a lot with those who have come from a foreign country and received education in the US. As a major workforce of technology industry, their contributions are undeniable. I think this is a great proposal that shows the US values, openness and equal opportunities. I don't see they get the jobs because they are 'cheaper', while they actually fill the huge manpower gap in STEM fields. This expanding policy would definitely benefit technology industries as well as education.
Is Obama out of his mind, visas for more people to come take what little jobs out there from Americans, good grief, he has lost the mind he never had , one bad decision after another , and Americans are paying the price,
On first blush this seems to be a good idea. However it is not orking as planed! The foreighn student decides that instead of returning home? it would be better for him or her to remain in the USA. They stay and another USA CITIZEN becomes unemployed and goes on welfare. result of a good? idea gone wrong. Now cost of training and education of foreighn student brings about another USAcitizen increasing our cost of operation. If your are going to train the foreighn student , FORCEthem to return to their own country and NOTbe able to return to the USA. THINK about what you are doing.  Please think of USAfirst.  I am a WW2 combat veteran. Did Igo wrong to volunteer ???!!!!
Dear Thomas Hayden,I am not sure what situation provoked you like this and blaming entire Indian Graduates in US. You have to understand first, American Top Companies like Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Pepsi are all running under Indian born CEO's who graduated over here and there are N numbers who contributed to Silicon Valley. We paid back to US much more than we received. If you get a chance, I would personally advice you go and interview each CEO's of big MNC and ask them about our work ethics. Then you will come to know who we are. But don't say we faked our exams, faked resume, faked the job. If this all true, then why Top Companies still hire lot of Indian Graduates. And also , I can see that, you said we can't even speak proper English. But I like to clarify this, no university in US will select a candidate unless until he/she cleared TOEFL/IELTS English Exam. Please check the statistics , Indian population tops in speaking English than any other Asian Countries.Overall, Please don't underestimate the talent of Indian Graduates in US.
If the reported numbers were honest  unemployment would be more like 10 percent.  Importing workers who would be willing to accept less than prevailing wages in the industry &amp; position is wrong.  Having lost 2 jobs 'off-shoring', this is no better.
F.L. Hinchey1424 Holly Ridge DrKeller, TXIt is without logic to allow additional persons to enter the US as workers in the face of releasing former prison inmates who will need jobs to prevent re-incarceration as well as the demand for employment for US citizens who are completing school to prepare them for some of those same available positions.   If you truly represent the people who elected you to public office, pay your salary and perks, as well as provide for your retirement, the least that could be expected is for you to protect the job opportunities available in the US for these  individuals and their offspring who supported your election.
This is a request that the Department of Homeland Security is NOT allowed to expand Optional Practical Training program.  Originally, the program was for foreign students who planned to return home upon completion of their training.  Now, many stay.  This has caused 430,000 jobs lost by US students in the 2009 - 2013 time period at a cost of $4 billion to Social Security and Medicare funds.  If hired, employers save money because they do not have to pay FICA and Medicare taxes on these non-citizens.Please do not allow expansion of this program.
This plan by DHS categorizes the foreign student/employee in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. There is not a shortage of qualified American workers in STEM fields. Giving employers a disincentive to hire American workers is unfair.The Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of Americans with and without degrees who are qualified to fill these STEM jobs.Like other employment visa programs, the Optional Practical Training program works to lower wages and living standards of the middle class. If workers with such training are needed, why isnt the program for American students instead? OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2103 and OPT removed $4billion from Social Security and Medicare trust funds. OPT=working against Americans
This is a good rule that needs to be passed very beneficial for retaining talented international students. I support this !!!
I strongly support this proposal base on the following opinions:1. Benefits to the U.S. economy.U.S. has been the #1 country in the world for years, and one of the main reasons of this success is because of its diversity.Ever since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, technology innovation has become a key factor of determining a countrys place in the world, and U.S. sure grabbed this gist. This country draws talented people in by its world-class working and living environment, and pay them back with its welcoming and open mind. It brings people from different parts of the world and cultures together to do great things. There are immigrants contributing to almost every industry: IT, space exploration, military, movie, medical field, etc., and a lot of them are on the top of their respective fields. To draw more talented people in and make this country stay competitive, extending OPT extension period for STEM students sure is a good way to provide more opportunities for international students to find a job and transit to H1-B visa in order to use the knowledge they learned from U.S. universities and contribute back to this country.According to a 2012 report from the Information Technology Industry Council(http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/stem-report.pdf), the Partnership for a New American Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, research has found that every foreign-born student who graduates from a U.S. university with an advanced degree and stays to work in STEM has been shown to create on average 2.62 jobs for American workersoften because they help lead in innovation, research, and development., and this report only shows the value and job opportunities STEM students had been creating until 2012. In fact, according to another report(http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf), immigrants were founders of 18 percent of all Fortune 500 companies, many of which are high-tech giants. As of 2010, these companies generated $1.7 trillion in annual revenue, employed 3.6 million workers worldwide, and included well known companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon, Google, United States Steel, Nordstrom, and so on. The value that STEM students have been and will be bringing to the U.S. economy and workforce is tremendous.(Reference: http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/always-demand-economic-contributions-immigrant-scientists-and-engineers)2. Benefits to the daily lives of American citizens.First and most important of all, STEM students create more job opportunities. More and more native-born workers get jobs and the ability to live a better life, which leads to a more health and stable society. As the growth of STEM related industries, other non-STEM industries will also experience a business booming caused by this growth. For example, the Yelp mobile app created a more direct way for information exchanging between businesses and customers and has been benefiting billions of businesses. In todays technology world, the influence of STEM industries are unignorable.In a smaller picture, the influence of the growth of STEM related industries to our lives is obvious. They make our daily activities easier and do the things that could only be seen in Sci-Fi movies 50 years ago. Google Map, Tesla electric car, Yelp, Uber, those innovations have become so close to our lives that we cannot even imagine how people in the 80th live without these technologies. It has been a true life-changing experience thanks to the booming of STEM industries.Last but not least, STEM students make America a truly multicultural society. In this very land of freedom, people has a chance to be friends with people from other part of the world, try different food, learn different cultures. It is not only what makes this country attractive for talented people from all over the world, but also how it becomes the #1 country in the world, and STEM students are a very important part of it.3. Benefits to STEM students.STEM students are eager to find a job in the U.S. after graduating from school. U.S. is the headquarter of innovations. Gaining industry-leading work experience could benefit their career and enhance businesses between U.S. and their home country. But as more and more STEM students coming in every year, the chance of winning the H1-B lottery becomes less and less. This leaves a lot of talented people no choice but go home. Extending OPT-Extension period could give them more chances to win the lottery and keep serving this country. For those highly competitive majors, this proposal could give those good-standing candidates more time to find a job so that their talent could have enough time to be discovered, and the companies could choose from best of the best.In conclusion, I think this proposal is a win-win for both U.S. government and STEM students. Therefore I strongly support it.
This program, according to information that I have received, has raided Social Security (2009-2013; plus may be the current situation) taking 1 billion dollars per year for a program that does not benefit Seniors.  As a senior, I feel that this has affected me personally.  The federal government took my personal money while I worked telling me that this money would be there when I needed it as a senior.  Now, the monies are being taken for something that I did not authorize nor will benefit me.  The federal government has robbed, has not been a good steward of the monies given, is giving away my money, and has created future problems for me and other seniors because of this action.  This is criminal action.  If a bank robber came into a bank and robbed money, the person(s) would go to jail and suffer the consequences.  Robbery of seniors, of which I am one, plus squandering of the monies is a total disservice to those who have given into Social Security no matter how lofty, eloquent, and technical you state your goals and aspirations to help "students".  My personal recommendation is that this and any similar program that takes money from Seniors ought to be completely dissolved.  The monies taken from Social Security need to be restored to their proper owners.
Surely the government of the United States is not trying to put non-citizens ahead of US Citizens by making it more profitable for companies to hire non-citizens.This would be illegal, unconstitutional, and not moral.
I support this new rule because it greatly helps the country to retain talents, encourage students to create values, innovate, and make use of what they learned from their degrees.
Support. This new rule will bring more talents into United States.It would be better if the extension is the same for students with STEM degrees and non-STEM degrees.
I strongly support the opt extension regulation. For one aspect, it benefit high-technology startups and companies as more highly-educated employees can contribute their knowledge in the technology field. In another aspect, they can generate more tax income for the government and accelerate the development of technology.
I am a co-founder of a tech startup in NYC. Nowadays it is extremely challenging to find qualified software engineers without considering international candidates. So far this year, my company's recruitment costs alone consumed about 30% of our seed fund. In the current market, companies need to pay a lot to recruit high quality programming talents to fill open positions in under six months. There are simply not enough qualified candidates in the existing job market. I don't see the point of further shrinking the candidate pool when it is already small if this proposal does not pass. There are about 7 people in our 30-person tech team who are on OPT/H1B and to be honest it would be a devastation to my company if I have to let all 7 of them go in February 2016. I read some of the comments here and frankly I don't understand why people keep mentioning the Disney example and saying that this program will take jobs from American citizens. The technology industry is very different than the old D's. Generally speaking, technology companies hire engineers and scientists, and through the products that they make, more jobs will be created. Hiring any engineer would help the U.S. economy. Take my company's business model as example, by successfully hiring a software engineer, regardless of whether or not they are a U.S. citizen, we can add more new features to our product. With new features and innovative products we can hire more salespeople, marketing people and tech support engineers to market and provide support to our customers. I cannot fathom why others are commenting that these engineers are taking American citizens' jobs. As far as I can see, they are creating more jobs for Americans. It is a simple win-win policy. I believe strengthening this STEM OPT extension program would create a constant stream of jobs in America. As long as STEM students are working in the innovation industries, they are bringing jobs in associated industries. The pros to our economy of maintain the STEM OPT extension program outweigh the cons. If this program is indeed terminated in February, it will not only strike my job-creating, tax-paying and economy-contributing company but many others as well. I don't mind going back to my previous job in Silicon Valley to make a decent salary. But it would be unwise to not let my international employees help with my company and the American economy.
I strongly support this extension. From personal perspective, the reason I choose US to study is US offers a longer period of training time. Also, those who think they cannot find a job because of international students are just not competitive enough. International students are just a tiny portion of people in US and would not affect US market by much.
vote for this
Our American students and young people have the highest unemployment rate in history, and, young black American citizens have the highest rate of unemployment ever recorded.   You have more American families on government assistance than ever in our history;  we must get financially responsible, and make the changes necessary to rectify this fact before we help anyone else or continue the debt spiral track we are on currently.  If we cannot get our debt under control, we cannot help anyone else in the world.  Please stop and think for a minute about what American citizens need first so we can be in a position to help others.    The FOIA request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two disgusting facts about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand;  1.  you are denying unemployed  American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 while telling us everything is great, I can assure you it is not;  we have the lowest labor participation rate in 30 years, Americans don't work we can help no one else help themselves.  And, 2. the program removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds when everyone is now aware both programs are a financial disaster for our country and the programs were a big cost lie when they were started, just like ACA.  We simply cannot afford to help everyone in the world without Americans getting back to work.    I believe your hearts are in the right place, but the timing is not good for our country;  I believe delaying and suspending all non-critical programs should be the rule.  Until we have our debts paid and our unfunded liabilities fully funded with a balanced budget, suspending this program is in the best interest of our country, so we will be in a position again in the future to help more people from other countries. Thank you so much for the opportunity to voice my opposition.
I strongly support this rule as this would be beneficial for both Students and US. I really appreciate if US govt. pass this proposed rule. It will benefit economically and technically.
An eviction of American educated foreign scientists, engineers, and mathematicians would create a brain drain that seems counter-intuitive in the pursuit of maintaining American global leadership in technology and sciences. Industry professionals and graduate students who have honed in on their areas of expertise would be forced to take their knowledge that they have developed during their time here back to their respective country of origins. It would be highly advantageous to retain qualified and productive members of society that contribute to a healthy economy and work in fields that create new job opportunities for our American counterparts.
I totally support this rule to extend the STEM OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months due to the following reasons.1)Around 900,000 international students studied in US colleges and universities during the 2013-14 school year which contributed almost $27 billion dollars to the U.S. economy. If this rule is not passed the number of students coming to study in U.S. will drastically decline and will be a great loss to the U.S. economy2)Also the jobs for which STEM students apply for are available for every one U.S. nationals as well as International students. So its a fair opportunity for every one. On the other hand there are many jobs for which only U.S. nationals can apply, so this gives them more opportunities over STEM students.3)There is currently a shortage of people with degree in STEM fields in U.S.. If this rule is not passed most of the international students would have to go back to their respective country. and U.S. might have to outsource the work the other countries.Thus to avoid a big impact on U.S. economy and for the betterment of the STEM students I support this rule.
The extension for the OPT is ennormously important to F1 students with STEM degrees and would have positive effect on international students' willingness to come to study in the US.
F-1 non immigrant students come here to better their academic value by pursuing higher degrees in their interested  STEM field of study very rigorously. The advance research facilities and faculty of the many universities in the United States attract such students to add value to their academic career but all this will be in vain if they are not given a chance to get exposed to practical training in the American Industry to apply their knowledge and expand their horizon by adhering to the global work culture which is seen here in every industry and this training should be given ample time for them to progress and apply their knowledge successfully. Extending and improving training opportunities for non immigrant students must be made mandatory taking due regard to such students' voices to advance their career effectively in the future because theoretical skills are wasted otherwise if not given a chance to apply practically for everyday problems for finding cutting edge solutions and such training platforms are not present in the third world countries from which most of such students come from. So in my opinion the concerned authorities must consider improving and expanding training opportunities with STEM degrees for all eligible F-1 students.
